//Write a program that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
//Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:
//   We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. 
//   So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
//The result is: 9.
