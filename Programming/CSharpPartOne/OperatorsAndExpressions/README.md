Operators and Expressions
-------------------------------------
1.	Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.
*	Write a boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divide (without remainder) by **7** and **5** in the same time.
*	Write an expression that calculates rectangle's area by given `width` and `height`.
*	Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit (right-to-left) is **7**. E. g. 1732 -> true.
*	Write a boolean expression for finding if the bit **3** (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.
*	Write an expression that checks if given point (`x`,  `y`) is within a circle **K(O, 5)**.
*	Write an expression that checks if given positive integer number `n` (`n` ≤ 100) is prime. E.g. 37 is prime
*	Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides `a` and `b` and height `h`.
*	Write an expression that checks for given point (`x`, `y`) if it is within the circle **K( (1,1), 3)** and out of the rectangle **R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2)**.
*	Write a boolean expression that returns if the bit at position `p` (counting from 0) in a given integer number `v` has value of **1**. Example: v=5; p=1 -> false.
*	Write an expression that extracts from a given integer `i` the value of a given bit number `b`. Example: i=5; b=2 -> value=1.
*	We are given integer number `n`, value `v` (v=0 or 1) and a position `p`. Write a sequence of operators that modifies `n` to hold the value `v` at the position `p` from the binary representation of `n`.

		Example: n = 5 (00000101), p=3, v=1 -> 13 (00001101)
				 n = 5 (00000101), p=2, v=0 -> 1 (00000001)
*	Write a program that exchanges bits **3, 4** and **5** with bits **24, 25** and **26** of given 32-bit unsigned integer.
*	* Write a program that exchanges bits **{p, p+1, …, p+k-1)** with bits **{q, q+1, …, q+k-1}** of given 32-bit unsigned integer.
