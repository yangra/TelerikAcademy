1. Write a program that reads **3** integer numbers from the console and prints their sum.
*	Write a program that reads the radius `r` of a circle and prints its perimeter and area.
*	A company has name, address, phone number, fax number, web site and manager. The manager has first name, last name, age and a phone number. Write a program that reads the information about a company and its manager and prints them on the console.
*	Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers and prints how many numbers `p` exist between them such that the reminder of the division by 5 is 0 (inclusive). Example: **p(17,25) = 2**.
*	Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Don’t use `if` statements.
*	Write a program that reads the coefficients `a`, `b` and `c` of a quadratic equation **ax2+bx+c=0** and solves it (prints its real roots).
*	Write a program that gets a number `n` and after that gets more `n` numbers and calculates and prints their sum. 
*	Write a program that reads an integer number `n` from the console and prints all the numbers in the interval **[1..n]**, each on a single line.
*	Write a program to print the first 100 members of the sequence of Fibonacci: **0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, …**
*	Write a program to calculate the sum (with accuracy of 0.001): **1 + 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/5 + ...**
*	*Implement the "Falling Rocks" game in the text console. A small dwarf stays at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right (by the arrows keys). A number of rocks of different sizes and forms constantly fall down and you need to avoid a crash. Rocks are the symbols `^, @, *, &, +, %, $, #, !, ., ;, -` distributed with appropriate density. The dwarf is (O). Ensure a constant game speed by `Thread.Sleep(150)`.Implement collision detection and scoring system.
