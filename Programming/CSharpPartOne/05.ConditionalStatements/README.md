1.	Write an `if` statement that examines two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.
*	Write a program that shows the **sign** (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers without calculating it. Use a sequence of if statements.
*	Write a program that finds the biggest of three integers using nested if statements.
*	Sort 3 real values in descending order using nested if statements.
*	Write program that asks for a digit and depending on the input shows the name of that digit (in English) using a switch statement.
*	Write a program that enters the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation
		**a*x2 + b*x + c = 0**
and calculates and prints its real roots. Note that quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
*	Write a program that finds the greatest of given 5 variables.
*	Write a program that, depending on the user's choice inputs `int`, `double` or `string` variable. If the variable is integer or double, increases it with 1. If the variable is string, appends `*` at its end. The program must show the value of that variable as a console output. Use `switch` statement.
*	We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that checks if the sum of some subset of them is 0. Example: 3, -2, 1, 1, 8 -> 1+1-2=0.
*	Write a program that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1..9]. The program reads a digit as an input. If the digit is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10; if it is between 4 and 6, multiplies it by 100; if it is between 7 and 9, multiplies it by 1000. If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the program must report an error.
Use a `switch` statement and at the end print the calculated new value in the console.
*	*Write a program that converts a number in the range [0...999] to a text corresponding to its English pronunciation. Examples:
	
>0 -> "Zero"

>273 -> "Two hundred seventy three"

>400 -> "Four hundred"

>501 -> "Five hundred and one"

>711 -> "Seven hundred and eleven"
